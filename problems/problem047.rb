# The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:
#
# 14 = 2  7
# 15 = 3  5
#
# The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:
#
# 644 = 2Â²  7  23
# 645 = 3  5  43
# 646 = 2  17  19.
#
# Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct primes factors. What is the first of these numbers?
